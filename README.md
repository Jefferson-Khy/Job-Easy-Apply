# Job-Easy-Apply
This was a simple bot I attempted to apply to easy apply jobs on the job page of Linkedin

I used:  
  python v3.10.5
  VSCODE
  Chromedriver
  
At the time of making this I was just looking for an easy way to apply to jobs so I can study for intereviews while this automation bot was applying for bots for me. 

First I verified I had python on my system 
Next downloaded python extension on VSCODE
Next downloaded chrome driver matching my current chrome version (make sure you know the path of this file)
Next I created a folder where I was going to keep my python script
Next I created a .py file in VSCODE inside my folder I created in the step above
Next I installed selenium using terminal in VSCODE
Finally, I would make adjustments to the code as needed and run the program form VSCODE


Currently as is the jobapply.py file will go through 1 easy apply job application and thats it. I will imporve it more in the future.
